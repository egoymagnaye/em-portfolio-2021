        "Egoy is a great communicator and he is motivated and hard working. These qualities made working with him very enjoyable and I felt confident that he would deliver exactly what was expected. I have worked with a few developers in my time and I can honestly say Egoy is one of the best. He was incredibly patient as I took extra time to approve the site and he turned changes around fast so that we maintained momentum even when I caused delays.",

He has been a good communicator throughout the experience and I feel confident that he is able to produce what I have asked for. If there are any issues, he would articulate the problem and provide me with alternative solutions. Either way he always keeps me in the loop, I would be happy to recommend him to my close friends and trusted network.",
